# Half-Life-4

Hi cheeky scrublords,

First of all...Welcome to the matrix.

This is an open source Unity based game project, where your imagination is the only limit.

If you have an idea, send me a pm and i will add you to the repo.

Make your idea real and extend the existing code with it, before the existing code extend you.

It can be a modell, code, sampleText, lensFlare

The only rule of this game:

    -you cant delete anything

          -the maximum what can you do is: 

              -edit something for compatibility reasons

              -debug
            
  (if you delete anything the bannHammer.jpg will vanish you)
